# Workshop-2-2019

The next meeting of the XProc next community group will take place on February 5 â€“ 6 2019 hosted by University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic.

It is just before [XML Prague 2019](http://www.xmlprague.cz), so why not attend both?

For details please see the [wiki pages](https://github.com/xproc/Workshop-2019-02/wiki/Community-group-meeting-2019-02).
